# The-Perfect-Guess  
We are goinf to write a program that generates a random number and asks the user to 
guess it.

If the player's guess is higher than the actual number, the program displays "Lower
number please". Similary, if the user's guess is too low, the program prints"higher
number please" when the user guesses the correct number, the program displays the 
number of guesses the player used arrive at the number.
